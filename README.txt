Language: Python 
Assignment: TCP Socket Connection 

Instructions: 

1. Start python code. Host IP will be displayed in the console. 

2. Connect to the host with port 6789 (IP.IP.IP.IP:PORT/Path)

2a. To access the HelloWorld.html, visit it's relative path
Example: 123.12.12.1:6789/HelloWorld.html 

2b. To access the 404 page, visit any other relative path
Example: 123.12.12.1:6789/AnythingElse

Note: The HTML may not be properly rendered the first time, and 
you may see a server unavailable. This is only because of the buffer
speed of the program. Simply reload the URL, it will properly load on
the second or third time at most.
